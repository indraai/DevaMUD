SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT ASK
If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say,tell,whisper or shout.
Example : say I'm a jerk
          tell unclesam You're dead meat - sucker!

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

' hello there.
#

If you feel like bouncing round the room this is just the command for you.
#
FRENCH
Don't you know how they kiss in France ?? - try it !
#
QUI SHUTDOW
Just to prevent accidental quittings and/or shutdowns.
This command doesn't DO anything, it simply is.
#
SMILE
Whenever you feel like smiling...
#
KILL HIT
A good way to start a fight.
#
KICK
Fighters only.
The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The higher
level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch - whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three
rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!

Fighters See Also : Rescue, Bash
#
BASH
Fighters only.
The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned. To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear. The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence. If you miss you loose
your balance and fall.
A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.
Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5*damage.

Fighters Only.
A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the person being

useable when playing in groups.
#
STEAL

Thief Only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels. Furtermore steal takes time to perform. you can't just
rush in, steal 20-30 times and quit (unless you have a LOT of time).

Example:

> steal gold drunk

> steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

#
BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place you dagger in his
back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful backstab
gives a damage multiplier, depending on level.

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild. You can always backstab sleeping
persons.

ability to use magic of any sort.
   You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

locks.

any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this particular notion
of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#

like when fighting or lying wounded on the ground, you will loose EXP!!!

See also: INN
#
INN INNS

after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you may use inns to store your
gathered equipment while you are not playing the game (we all have to sleep
sometimes, there is no shame in that).

tell you the cost of storing your carried items for one day. 'rent' will store

you have the gold to pay the rent.

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little uncomfortable
(maybe your are dying), just type 'flee', and presto! you are out of harm's way
- that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit doesn't simply
bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, who wants to live forever?

    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

We strongly disencourage killing of other players, but the choice is yours.

GROUP
Usage : GROUP [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among

blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Avati wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Avati: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group avati"
